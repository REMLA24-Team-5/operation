## Comments for A1:
Below we specify all the things we have implemented for each section.
# Project best practices: 
- we have split the code into different files and structed the repository using the data science template of cookie cutter
- Poetry allows for installation of the correct dependencies.
- the dataset is automatically downloaded as part of the dvc pipeline (UPDATE IF CHANGED)
- exploratory code has been removed from python files and is only visible in the `notebooks` folder
- the README includes the steps as to how to use our repository

# Pipeline Management:
- the pipeline can be run with `dvc repro`
- a remote storage has been configured using Google Drive
- DVC is used to report metrics and to keep track of different experiments/models.
- Different metrics are reported beyond model correctness

# Code Quality
- The project follows code quality best practices
- Pylint yields a perfect score and was properly configured.
- Configuration decisions follow ML conventions and are properly motivated in the Readme file
- Both dslinter (extension of pylint) and Bandit are configured and code quality information is displayed in the Readme
- In the Readme we critically analyse the linter rules, and propose changes that fit the ML project
