## Comments for A1:
Below we specify all the things we have implemented for each section.
# Project best practices: 
- we have split the code into different files and structed the repository using the data science template of cookie cutter
- the requirements.txt allows for installation of the correct dependencies (UPDATE IF CHANGED)
- the dataset is automatically downloaded as part of the dvc pipeline (UPDATE IF CHANGED)
- exploratory code has been removed from python files and is only visible in the `notebooks` folder
- the README includes the steps as to how to use our repository

# Pipeline Management:
- the pipeline can be run with `dvc repro`
- a remote storage has been configured using Google Drive
- metrics are used to keep track of model performance (UPDATE)

# Code Quality
- TODO
